## Purpose

The creator of Dracula Pro emphasizes transparency, as highlighted on the [official website](https://draculatheme.com/pro/changelog):

> One of my goals with Dracula PRO is to be as transparent as possible. This includes opening revenue numbers and sharing what happened along the way (even when it's not good).

Since the release of Dracula Pro version 2.0, users across various platforms like Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs, XCode, and others have encountered numerous issues.

This tracker aims to document all relevant details, helping maintainers address issues more efficiently and uphold the commitment to transparencyâ€”similar to [the Monokai Pro issue tracker](https://github.com/Monokai/monokai-pro-vscode).
